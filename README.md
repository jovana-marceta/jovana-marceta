### Hello World! 🌏

My name is Jovana. I am a Front End Developer with 1 year of experience.

I studied Web design at [The Higher Education Technical School of Professional Studies](http://vtsns.edu.rs/about-the-school/) in Novi Sad 🎓. Here I had an opportunity to learn the basics of Computer Science, programming, graphic and web design. I choose Front-end development because I am an analytical person and love coding 💻.

I worked as a Front-end Developer at [Vega IT](https://www.vegait.rs/) company and had an internship at [Libra Fire](https://www.librafire.com/) agency.

My speciality is converting Photoshop / Adobe XD static pages design to live responsive websites using HTML, CSS, JavaScript. I would like to improve my JavaScript knowledge and my goal is to learn React framework to create dynamic web applications.

Feel free to message me ✉️ at <strong>jmarcetafedev@gmail.com</strong>, I am always looking for new connections and opportunities.
